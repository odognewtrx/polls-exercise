# polls-exercise

This is an extension of the Django "getting started" tutorial that concentrates on areas the author finds most interesting to learn. As such, the code may not be the easiest way to implement a simple site.

Areas that are emphasized here are: zurb Foundation grid styling, html generated in client with software style jQuery/javascript code, server communication with JSON objects using the Rest framework, Ajax requests and promises, multi-container docker-compose deployment.
